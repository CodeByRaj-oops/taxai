- Standard deduction of â‚¹50,000
- Very limited deductions and exemptions
- Simpler tax calculation
- Section 87A rebate available if income is below â‚¹7 lakh

- Taxable Income after deductions: â‚¹9,75,000
- Tax Calculation:
  - First â‚¹2,50,000: No tax
  - Next â‚¹2,50,000: â‚¹12,500 (5%)
  - Next â‚¹5,00,000: â‚¹1,00,000 (20%)

- Total Income Tax: â‚¹1,65,000

**New Tax Regime:**

- Your income of â‚¹6,90,000 falls within this limit
- After the standard deduction of â‚¹50,000, your taxable income would be â‚¹6,40,000

- Next â‚¹3,00,000: â‚¹15,000 (5% tax)

- Net tax liability: â‚¹0

- Maximum rebate amount is â‚¹25,000
- Effectively makes income up to â‚¹7,00,000 tax-free under the New Regime

**Eligibility criteria:**
- You must be a resident individual
- Your total income after all deductions should not exceed â‚¹7,00,000
- The rebate is applicable to the calculated tax amount before adding cess

This rebate significantly benefits individuals with income around or below â‚¹7,00,000, as they potentially pay zero income tax under the New Regime.
