5. Life Insurance Premiums - For self, spouse, and children
6. Tuition fees for children - For full-time education
7. Home Loan Principal Repayment - For self-occupied property

3. 50% of basic salary (metro city): â‚¹25,000

The minimum of these three is â‚¹15,000.

Therefore, your monthly HRA exemption would be â‚¹15,000, or â‚¹1,80,000 annually. This amount would be exempt from your taxable income.

NPS is especially beneficial for high-income individuals who have already exhausted the 80C limit. It combines tax savings with retirement planning, though it comes with a lock-in period until retirement age (60 years).

- Multiple deductions and exemptions allowed:
  - Section 80C investments (up to â‚¹1.5 lakh)

  - HRA exemption for rent paid

**New Tax Regime:**

- Standard deduction of â‚¹50,000
- Very limited deductions and exemptions

   - No upper limit for rented property (actual interest paid is deductible)

2. Section 80C: Principal repayment

Additional benefits:
- First-time homebuyers can claim an additional deduction of up to â‚¹1,50,000 under Section 80EEA for loans sanctioned before March 31, 2025 (conditions apply)
- Stamp duty and registration charges are also eligible for deduction under Section 80C

3. Lock-in Period: Shortest among all 80C instruments - only 3 years (compared to 5 years for tax-saving FDs, 15 years for PPF)

4. Taxation of Gains: Long-term capital gains above â‚¹1 lakh are taxed at 10% without indexation benefit

ELSS is particularly suitable for:
- Young investors with a higher risk appetite
- Those seeking potential for capital appreciation along with tax benefits
- Investors with a long-term horizon who can withstand market volatility

- Current investments and deductions you're claiming
- Your specific financial goals and risk tolerance
